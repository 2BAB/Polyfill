Polyfill is a middleware to assist writing Gradle Plugins for Android build system.

## Why need Polyfill?

As its name suggests, the lib is a **middle-ware** between **AGP** (Android Gradle Plugin) and **3rd Gradle Plugin**
based on AGP context. For example, the [ScratchPaper](https://github.com/2BAB/ScratchPaper) is a plugin to add an
overlay to your app icons which based on AGP, it consumes:

- SDK Locations / BuildToolInfo instance (to run aapt commands)
- Merged AndroidManifest.xml (to get the resolved icon name)

Those inputs usually caused problems:

1. They are open-source but not exposed directly, sometimes you may need to use reflect to retrieve the input you need.
2. They may change when updating to a new AGP version, again, because those are mainly for internal usage.

In 2018, I started to consider if we can make a Polyfill layer for 3rd Android Gradle Plugin developers, and finally
released the first version in 2020 as you can see here. The name "Polyfill" comes from the FrontEnd tech-stack, which
makes the JS code compatible with old/odd browser APIs.

To be noticed, starting from AGP 4.1.0, the AGP team provides a new public API set called **"Variant/Artifact API"**. ~~
However, this is a very early stage that only provides less than 10 artifacts' API for developers to use.~~ **AGP
released 2-3 minor versions per year, developers may need to stay tuned, expect their own requirement get quickly
implemented in next few years. (Please raise your requests to AGP thread of issue tracker more.)**

Check all latest exported Artifacts
here: [SingleArtifact](https://developer.android.com/reference/tools/gradle-api/current/com/android/build/api/artifact/SingleArtifact)
, [MultipleArtifact](https://developer.android.com/reference/tools/gradle-api/current/com/android/build/api/artifact/MultipleArtifact)
.(The "Known Direct Subclasses" portion)

That's why I still insist to create Polyfill lib and wish one day we can 100% migrate to Artifacts API.

## What does Polyfill provide?

- It encapsulates AGP (Android Gradle Plugin) APIs, turn them to **Task Hook Points** (action) and **Task Inputs** for
  all 3rd plugin developer to easily interact with.
    - **Task Hook Points:** for instance, if the developer wants to intercept manifest merge input files, he/she should
      find producer task(s) and consumer task of input files, then add a new custom task that will be executed between
      them; here the Hook Points means we define an action who process the task order stuffs and make sure the new-added
      runs on the true timing, Polyfill provides many `AGPTaskAction.kt` (the impl such
      as `ManifestBeforeMergeAction.kt`) to complete this job.
    - **Task Inputs:** with the help of Hook Points, your task logic can now be executed during the right time, what you
      might miss is task input(s), for example, Manifest files, Android SDK locations, AGP versions, etc. To configure
      them easily, Polyfill provides `SelfManageableProvider.kt` (the impl such as `ManifestMergeInputProvider.kt`) to
      fetch the task input(s).
- Meanwhile, it provides a bunch of tools working on build intermediates, such as binary parser and builder
  for `resources.arsc`, `AndroidManifest.xml`.

## Quick Start

1. Add Polyfill to build classpath:

``` kotlin
// If add to `buildSrc/build.gradle(.kts)` or standalone plugin project, 
// add them to your project's `dependencies{}` block:
dependencies {
    implementation("com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.0.3")
    // Core dependency 
    implementation("me.2bab:polyfill:0.4.0")
    // Add one or more artiface(s)-provider as you want ($latestVersion -> same as the core version)
    classpath("me.2bab:polyfill-manifest:$latestVersion")
    classpath("me.2bab:polyfill-res:$latestVersion")
    classpath("me.2bab:polyfill-arsc:$latestVersion")
    ...
}

// If you only extend the build inside `build.gradle(.kts)` script, 
// add them to Root project's `build.gradle.kts`.
buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath("com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.0.3")
        // Core dependency 
        classpath("me.2bab:polyfill:0.4.0")
        // Add one or more artiface(s)-provider as you want ($latestVersion -> same as the core version)
        classpath("me.2bab:polyfill-manifest:$latestVersion")
        classpath("me.2bab:polyfill-res:$latestVersion")
        classpath("me.2bab:polyfill-arsc:$latestVersion")
        ...
    }
}
```

2. Write some custom tasks based on Polyfill (follow the steps of comment):

``` kotlin
val androidExtension = project.extensions.findByType(AndroidComponentsExtension::class.java)!!
androidExtension.onVariants { variant ->

    // 0. Get Polyfill instance with Project instance
    val polyfill = ApplicationVariantPolyfill(project, variant)

    // 1. Create & Config the hook task.
    val preUpdateTask = project.tasks.register(
        "preUpdate${variant.name.capitalize()}Manifest",
        TestPlugin.ManifestBeforeMergeTask::class.java
    ) {
        val p = polyfill.newProvider(ManifestMergeInputProvider::class.java).obtain()
        beforeMergeInputs.set(p)
    }
    // 2. Add it with the action (which plays the role of entry for a hook).
    val beforeMergeAction = ManifestBeforeMergeAction(preUpdateTask)
    polyfill.addAGPTaskAction(beforeMergeAction)
}

// Prepare a task containing specific hook logic.
abstract class ManifestBeforeMergeTask : DefaultTask() {
    @get:InputFiles
    abstract val beforeMergeInputs: SetProperty<FileSystemLocation>

    @TaskAction
    fun beforeMerge() {
        val manifestPathsOutput = TestPlugin.getOutputFile(project, "manifests-merge-input.json")
        manifestPathsOutput.createNewFile()
        beforeMergeInputs.get().let { set ->
            manifestPathsOutput.writeText(JSON.toJSONString(set.map { it.asFile.absolutePath }))
        }
    }
}
```

Check more in `./test-plugin` and `./polyfill/src/functionalTest`.

## Compatible Specification

Polyfill is only supported & tested on latest **2** Minor versions of Android Gradle Plugin.

**Changelog** can be found from [Github Releases](https://github.com/2BAB/Polyfill/releases).

| AGP Version | Latest Support Version |

|    4.2.0    |  0.3.1 (MavenCentral)  |

(The project currently compiles with the latest version of AGP 7.0, and compiles and tests against the both AGP 7.0 and
7.1 on CI.)
